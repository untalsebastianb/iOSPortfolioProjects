## Hello 🙋🏻‍♂️
This is Juancho, I wanna show you a tiny app I did using SwiftUI entirely, this was just to sharp my UI creation skills, using all the SwiftUI framework apis needed for this :) <br>
Here is quick view of the app <br>

Here I practice Text orientation, Backgrounds, Paddings, Stacks, Spacers, Fonts, Colors and many more.. <br>

take a look to the code if you wanna see how I make this UI 🎨.
