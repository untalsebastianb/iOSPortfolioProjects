# Welcome to MiniTwiiter!

Hi! I'm Juancho 🙋🏼‍♂️, I just want to introduce you to this amazing app I've build using Swif.

The Mini Twitter app is basically the result of putting together Tables, Networking calls, Navigation, Notifications, User experience and more.
 You'll start with a Login Page where you can Sign in or Signup with your own user, after that you'll land on a board make using tables where you can find all the tweets ( custom Cell ) that people who used the same resources has publised! amazing right? 😎

From there you can create your own tweet and see it on the board view, but if you change your mind, using the Swipe gesture you can delete your mess 🚮 , while using the app you will find banners to improve your experience and some progress elements to let you know that views is loading. 

Try the app by your own, and let me know your thoughts about it.
Thanks you for being here!!

**Built with** [Swift](https://www.swift.org/)
