# Welcome to MiniTwiiter!
Hi! I'm Juancho üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I just want to introduce you to this amazing app I've built using Swift.<br>

The Mini Twitter app is basically the result of putting together Tables, Networking calls, Navigation, Notifications, User experience, and more. You'll start with a Login Page where you can Sign in or Signup with your own user, after that, you'll land on a board made using tables where you can find all the twiits ( custom Cells ) that people who used the same resources has published! amazing right? üòé<br>

From there you can create your own tweet and see it on the board view, but if you change your mind, using the Swipe gesture you can delete your mess üöÆ , while using the app you will find banners to improve your experience and some progress elements to let you know that views is loading.<br>

Also for the purpose of this project I've used CocoaPods to add some libraries to create a full experience using the app, here are the POD's:<br>

NotificationBannerSwift<br>
SVProgressHUD<br>
Simple-Networking<br>
