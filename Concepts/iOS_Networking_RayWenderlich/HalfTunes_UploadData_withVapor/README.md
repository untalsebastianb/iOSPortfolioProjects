Hi 👋🏻 <br>
In this project I used the Upload task feature to send information to an own server created using vapor, creating a HTTPRequest and the upload task to fire it using the URLSession <br>
As a result I printed out the Client and the server response to check that everything was working as expected!! <br>

client response: <br>
![ClientResponse](https://github.com/untalsebastianb/iOSPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Concepts/iOS_Networking_RayWenderlich/HalfTunes_UploadData_withVapor/ClientResponse.png) <br>
server response: <br>
