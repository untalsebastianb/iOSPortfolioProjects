Hi Again! <br>
this project was done using webSockets, the idea for this project was to learn how to implement web sockets within an app. <br>
here you'll find 2 folders: <br>
▪︎ Server - Server project creating a route with web socket using Vapor <br> 
▪︎ WebSocket - Client side using SwiftUI <br>


the main idea was to send data to a server using URLSessionWebSocketTask as the path to follow from the iOSNetworking course. <br>
setting up the connection and sending messages to the server. <br>

Demo here:
