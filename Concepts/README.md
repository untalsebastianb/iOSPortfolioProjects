Hi, 🙋🏼‍♂️ <br>
on this folder you'll find some work I've done, it can be small projects to practice a topic or projects that I did while studying. <br>
it also can be some playgrounds that I did while studying and performing some iOS/Swift concepts

My main study platform is rayWenderlich, I've become a PRO subscriber on this platform to rock up my career as an iOS Developer. <br>

Thank you for being here.
