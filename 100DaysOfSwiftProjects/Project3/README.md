On the days 16th, 17th, and 18th of #100DaysOfSwift, I builded this little project implementing a detail screen and presenting the image with a navigationController push. <br>

I've covered the next topics:<br>
‣ The FileManager class.<br>
‣ Table views and image views<br>
‣ App bundles<br>
‣ Typecasting<br>
‣ View controllers, storyboards, outlets, Auto Layout, UIImage.<br>

Building a detail screen and loading images with UIImage<br>

Final tweaks: hidesBarsOnTap, safe area margins<br>


For the 3rd project on day 22, I added a feature about sharing the app <br>
