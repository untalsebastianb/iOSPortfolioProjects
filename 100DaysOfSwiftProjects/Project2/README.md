On the days 19th, 20th, 21st of #100DaysOfSwift challenge, I developed this funny game about guessing the flag<br>
once you start tapping on the flag you'll notify with an alet and automatically raise or decrease your score<br>

I went through:
‣ Array shuffling
‣ Random number generation,
‣ IBAction,
‣ UIAlertController,
‣ AutoLayout.
‣ View controllers, storyboards, UIImage.

Demo: <br>
