On the days 19th, 20th, 21st of #100DaysOfSwift challenge, I developed this funny game about guessing the flag<br>
once you start tapping on the flag you'll notify with an alet and automatically raise or decrease your score<br>

I went through: <br>
â€£ Array shuffling <br>
â€£ Random number generation <br>
â€£ IBAction <br>
â€£ UIAlertController <br>
â€£ AutoLayout <br>
â€£ View controllers, storyboards, UIImage <br>

Demo: <br>
