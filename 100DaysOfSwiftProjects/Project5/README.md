## Hi 🙋🏼‍♂️
On the days 27th, 28th, 29th of #100DaysOfSwift, I built a World Scramble game. <br>

To do that, I applied some knowledge and good practices, on the game you are able to: <br>

⍟ Reload the game with a new word, pressing the top left button <br>
⍟ Add words <br>

Take in mind that there are some rules to play the game: <br>
⦿ You cannot repeat already used words <br>
⦿ Your word should have at least 4 letters <br>
⦿ You can't make up words ( I used UITextChecker for this 💡) <br>

Knowledge applied: 
☑︎ Insert rows and reload the data  <br>
☑︎ TextFields in AlertController <br>
☑︎ Strings and UTF-16<br>
☑︎ Closures <br>
☑︎ NSRange <br>

Evidence:  <br>
