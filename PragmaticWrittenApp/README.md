# Welcome to ProgramaticWrittenApp!
Hi! I'm Juancho üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I just want to introduce you to this amazing app I've built using Swift.<br>

The ProgramaticWrittenApp is a full aplication written programatically, here I used collection views to represent data obtained from the server, Labels, TextFields, StackViews, Buttons, Images, NavigationController, Networking calls. all this to be able to write all these components without the InterfaceBuilder provide by Xcode, also used MagazineLayout to create the collectionView in a easier and advanced way and SnapKit to give constraints to the elements on the view üñå <br>


Also for the purpose of this project I've used Carthage as dependency manager and used the following POD's:<br>

MagazineLayout<br>
SnapKit<br>
